The following is a front end design of a Task Managment Website. There is not backend made to run the system.
I used html to design the websites. The pictures I used are attached but I used the urls instead of files since it wasn't working.
The design of this website is for a new comer to come exsplore and test out the feature of the website. As well as learn more about the services. The system also has a login or Sign Up.
I used a navbar to create a bar at the top that will allow you to move between the different cites.

The System offers the ability to create and manage tasks. The manage side allows you to create as well since was the full service. It allows you to edit or delete your task as well.
